# Logical operators

There are three logical operators in JavaScript: `||` (OR), `&&` (AND), `!` (NOT).

Although they are called "logical", they can be applied to values of any type, not only boolean. The result can also be of any type.

Let's see the details.

## || (OR)

The "OR" operator is represented with two vertical line symbols:

```js
result = a || b;
```

In classical programming, logical OR is meant to manipulate boolean values. If any of it's arguments is `true`, then it returns `true`, otherwise -- returns `false`.

In JavaScript the operator is a little bit more tricky and powerful. But first let's see what happens with boolean values.

There are four possible logical combinations:

```js run
alert( true || true );   // true
alert( false || true );  // true
alert( true || false );  // true
alert( false || false ); // false
```

As we can see, the result is always `true` except for the case when both operands are `false`.

If an operand is not boolean, then it's converted to boolean for the evaluation.

For instance, a number `1` is treated as `true`, a number `0` -- as `false`:

```js run
if (1 || 0) { // works just like if( true || false )
  alert( 'truthy!' );
}
```

Most of time, OR `||` is used in `if` to test if *any* of given conditions is correct.

For example:

```js run
let hour = 9;

*!*
if (hour < 10 || hour > 18) {
*/!*
  alert( 'The office is closed.' );
}
```

We can pass more conditions:

```js run
let hour = 12;
let isWeekend = true;

if (hour < 10 || hour > 18 || isWeekend) {
  alert( 'The office is closed.' ); // it is weekend
}
```

## OR seeks the first truthy value

The logic described above is somewhat classical. Now let's bring in the "extra" features of JavaScipt.

The extended algorithm works as follows.

Given multiple OR'ed values:

```js
result = value1 || value2 || value3;
```

The OR `"||"` operator is doing the following:

- Evalutes operands from left to right.
- For each value -- converts it to boolean. If it's true then stops and returns that value.
- If operands finished, returns the last value.

A value is returned in it's original form, without the conversion.

In other words, a chain of OR `"||"` returns the first truthy value or the last one if no such value found.

For instance:

```js run
alert( 1 || 0 ); // 1 (1 is truthy)
alert( true || 'no matter what' ); // (true is truthy)

alert( null || 1 ); // 1 (1 is the first truthy value)
alert( null || 0 || 1 ); // 1 (the first truthy value)
alert( undefined || null || 0 ); // 0 (all falsy, returns the last value)
```

That leads to some interesting usages compared to a "pure, classical, boolean-only OR".

1. **Getting the first truthy value from the list of variables or expressions.**

    Imagine we have several variables, which can either contain the data or be `null/undefined`. And we need to choose the first one with data.

    We can use OR `||` for that:

    ```js run
    let currentUser = null;
    let defaultUser = "John";

    *!*
    let name = currentUser || defaultUser || "unnamed";
    */!*

    alert( name ); // selects "John" â€“ the first truthy value
    ```

    If both `currentUser` and `defaultUser` were falsy then `"unnamed"` would be the result.
2. **Short-circuit evaluation.**

    Operands can be not only values, but arbitrary expressions. OR evaluates and tests them from left to right. The evaluation stops when a truthy value is reached, and the value is returned. The process is called "a short-circuit evaluation", because it goes as short as possible from left to right.

    This is clearly seen when the expression given as the second argument has a side effect. Like a variable assignment.

    If we run the example below, `x` would not get assigned:

    ```js run no-beautify
    let x;

    *!*true*/!* || (x = 1);

    alert(x); // undefined, because (x = 1) not evaluated
    ```

    ...And if the first argument is `false`, then `OR` goes on and evaluates the second one thus running the assignment:

    ```js run no-beautify
    let x;

    *!*false*/!* || (x = 1);

    alert(x); // 1
    ```

    An assignment is a simple case, other side effects can be involved.

    As we can see, such use case is a "shorter way to do `if`". The first operand is converted to boolean and if it's false then the second one is evaluated.

    Most of time it's better to use a "regular" `if` to keep the code easy to understand, but sometimes that can be handy.

## && (AND)

The AND operator is represented with two ampersands `&&`:

```js
result = a && b;
```

In classical programming AND returns `true` if both operands are truthy and `false` -- otherwise:

```js run
alert( true && true );   // true
alert( false && true );  // false
alert( true && false );  // false
alert( false && false ); // false
```

An example with `if`:

```js run
let hour = 12;
let minute = 30;

if (hour == 12 && minute == 30) {
  alert( 'Time is 12:30' );
}
```

Just as for OR, any value is allowed as an operand of AND:

```js run
if (1 && 0) { // evaluated as true && false
  alert( "won't work, because the result is falsy" );
}
```


## AND seeks the first falsy value

Given multiple AND'ed values:

```js
result = value1 && value2 && value3;
```

The AND `"&&"` operator is doing the following:

- Evalutes operands from left to right.
- For each value converts it to a boolean. If the result is `false`, stops and returns the original value.
- If values finished (all are truthy), returns the last one.

In other words, AND returns the first falsy value or the last value if none found.

The rules above are similar to OR. The difference is that AND returns the first *falsy* value while OR returns the first *truthy* one.

Examples:

```js run
// if the first operand is truthy,
// AND returns the second one:
alert( 1 && 0 ); // 0
alert( 1 && 5 ); // 5

// if the first operand is falsy,
// AND returns it, and the second one is ignored
alert( null && 5 ); // null
alert( 0 && "no matter what" ); // 0
```

We can also pass several values in a row. See how the first falsy one is returned:

```js run
alert( 1 && 2 && null && 3 ); // null
```

When all values are truthy, the last value is returned:

```js run
alert( 1 && 2 && 3 ); // 3, the last one
```

````smart header="AND `&&` executes before OR `||`"
The precedence of the AND `&&` operator is higher than OR `||`, so it executes before OR.

In the code below `1 && 0` is calculated first:

```js run
alert( 5 || 1 && 0 ); // 5
```
````

Just like OR, the AND `&&` operator can sometimes replace `if`.

For instance:

```js run
let x = 1;

(x > 0) && alert( 'Greater than zero!' );
```

The action in the right part of `&&` would execute only if the evaluation reaches it. That is: only if `(x > 0)` is true.

So we basically have an analogue for:

```js run
let x = 1;

if (x > 0) {
  alert( 'Greater than zero!' );
}
```

The variant with `&&` appears to be shorter. But `if` is more obvious and tends to be a little bit more readable.

So it is recommended to use every construct for it's purpose. Use `if` if we want if. And use `&&` if we want AND.

## ! (NOT)

The boolean NOT operator is represented with an exclamation sign `"!"`.

The syntax is pretty simple:

```js
result = !value;
```

The operator accepts a single argument and does the following:

1. Converts the operand to boolean type: `true/false`.
2. Returns an inverse value.

For instance:

```js run
alert( !true ); // false
alert( !0 ); // true
```

A double NOT `!!` is sometimes used for converting a value to boolean type:

```js run
alert( !!"non-empty string" ); // true
alert( !!null ); // false
```

That is: the first NOT converts the value to boolean and returns the inverse, and the second NOT inverses it again, at the end we have a plain value-to-boolean conversion.

There's a little more verbose to do the same -- a built-in `Boolean` function:

```js run
alert( Boolean("non-empty string") ); // true
alert( Boolean(null) ); // false
```
