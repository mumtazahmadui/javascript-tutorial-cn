# Which values shows the while?

For every loop, write down which values it shows, in your opinion. And then compare with the answer.

Both loops `alert` same values or not?

1. The prefix form `++i`:

    ```js
    let i = 0;
    while (++i < 5) alert( i );
    ```
2. The postfix form `i++`

    ```js
    let i = 0;
    while (i++ < 5) alert( i );
    ```
