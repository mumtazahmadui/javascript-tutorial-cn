Developers commonly wonder whether there is an ideal pattern or set of patterns they should be using in their workflow. There isn't a true single answer to this question; each script and web application we work on is likely to have its own individual needs and we need to think about where we feel a pattern can offer real value to an implementation.

Constructor Pattern
Module Pattern
Revealing Module Pattern
Singleton Pattern
Observer Pattern
Mediator Pattern
Prototype Pattern
Command Pattern
Facade Pattern
Factory Pattern
Mixin Pattern
Decorator Pattern
Flyweight Pattern
