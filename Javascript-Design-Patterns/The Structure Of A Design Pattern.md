A pattern is initially presented in the form of a rule that establishes a relationship between:

A context
A system of forces that arises in that context and
A configuration that allows these forces to resolve themselves in context
With this in mind, let’s now take a look at a summary of the component elements for a design pattern. A design pattern should have a:

Pattern name and a description
Context outline – the contexts in which the pattern is effective in responding to the users needs.
Problem statement – a statement of the problem being addressed so we can understand the intent of the pattern.
Solution – a description of how the user’s problem is being solved in an understandable list of steps and perceptions.
Design – a description of the pattern’s design and in particular, the user’s behavior in interacting with it
Implementation – a guide to how the pattern would be implemented
Illustrations – a visual representation of classes in the pattern (e.g. a diagram)
Examples – an implementation of the pattern in a minimal form
Co-requisites – what other patterns may be needed to support use of the pattern being described?
Relations – what patterns does this pattern resemble? does it closely mimic any others?
Known usage – is the pattern being used in the wild? If so, where and how?
Discussions – the team or author’s thoughts on the exciting benefits of the pattern
